          The jobs you will be working on in the future, don't even exist yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is what Farnam Jahanian, the president of Carnegie Mellon, said
          during our orientation in 2018. I truly believe this to be true.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't know what career I will have in the future, but I do know that
          the future requires interdisciplinary skills. The only thing I can do
          now is prepare myself for anything by positioning myself at the intersection of business, technology, and creativity.

          As a product manager, I have led multiple teams from ideation to delivery. From managing VR development teams to producing Diablo Immortal at Blizzard, I enjoy working with people, defining features that address users' pain points and delivering great products.

        <p>
          As a business analyst, I have conducted market and competitor research studies for Tencent. I also interned at ByteDance US as a business developer, conducting market and company strategy research studies while evaluating studios and games for potential investment/licensing deals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, I have developed full-stack websites using Ruby on Rails, back-end databases with SQL and Mongo, and front-end web design like the site you're seeing now. I have also developed 4 mobile games, 5 PC games, and 7 virtual reality games. Additionally, I have served as a teaching assistant for an iOS application development class at CMU and worked as a VR research assistant at CMU's Cognitive Development Lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a data scientist, I have visualized first-party user data from Tencent Games during my internship to provide 41 insights into customer behaviors. I have also analyzed more than 300 million anonymized accounts for PNC Bank and improved their coupon recommendation accuracy by 12%. I am proficient in R, Python, and have written machine learning algorithms from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University a semester early in December 2021 with a B.S. in Information Systems and a minor in Game Design, as well as a B.S. in Statistics and Machine Learning with a minor in Business Administration. I received a 4.0/4.0 GPA and university honors for both degrees.
        </p>
        <p>I am currently working at Apple, trying to push the limits of AR/VR. Prior to Apple, I was one of the core engineers at Meta Reality Labs who helped transform Meta's annual keynote event, Connect 22, into an immersive VR experience.</p>
