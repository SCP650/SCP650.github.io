          The job you will be working on in the future, don't even exist yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is what Farnam Jahanian, the president of Carnegie Mellon, said
          during our orientation in 2018. And I truly believe it.
        </p>

          I don't know what career I will have in the future, but I do know that
          the future requires interdisciplinary skills. The only thing I can do
          now is to prepare myself for anything. To let myself stand in the
          intersection of business, technology, and creativity.

          As a product manager, I have led multiple teams from ideation to
          delivery. From VR video games to web applications, I enjoy working
          with people, maintaining production schedules with tools like Kanban
          and JIRA, conducting user interviews, and defining features that solve our users' pain points.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a business analyst, I have done market and competitor research
          studies for Tencent. I interned at ByteDance US as a business
          developer, conducting market and company strategy research studies
          while evaluating studios and games for potential investment/licensing
          deals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, I developed full-stack websites with Ruby on
          Rails, back-end database with SQL and Mongo, and front-end web design
          like this site you are seeing now. I also helped developed 4 mobile
          games, 3 PC games, and 3 virtual reality games in the last two years.
          And I'm currently working on iOS application development and working
          as a VR research assistant at CMU's Cognitive Development Lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a data scientist, I visualized first-party user data from Tencent
          Games during my internship to provide 41 insights into customer
          behaviors. I've also analyzed more than 300 million anonymized accounts for PNC Bank and improved their coupon recommendation accuracy by 12%. I understand R, Python, and have written machine learning algorithms from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm graduating a semester early in December 2021 and I'm looking for full-time opportunities with a January 2022 start date.
