          The job you will be working on in the future, don't even exist yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is what Farnam Jahanian, the president of Carnegie Mellon, said
          during our orientation in 2018. And I truly believe it.

          I don't know what career I will have in the future, but I do know that
          the future requires interdisciplinary skills. The only thing I can do
          now is to prepare myself for anything. To let myself stand in the
          intersection of business, technology, and creativity.

          As a product manager, I have led multiple teams from ideation to
          delivery. From VR video games to web applications, I enjoy working
          with people, maintaining production schedules with tools like Kanban
          and JIRA, conducting user interviews, and defining features that fit
          our user stories.

          As a business analyst, I have done market and competitor research
          studies for Tencent. I interned at ByteDance US as a business
          developer, conducting market and company strategy research studies
          while evaluating studios and games for potential investment/licensing
          deals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, I developed full-stack websites with Ruby on
          Rails, back-end database with SQL and Mongo, and front-end web design
          like this site you are seeing now. I also helped developed 3 mobile
          games, 3 PC games, and 2 virtual reality games in the last two years.
          And I'm currently working on iOS application development and working
          as a VR research assistant at CMU's Cognitive Development Lab.

          As a data scientist, I visualized first-party user data from Tencent
          Games during my internship to provide insights about customer
          behaviors. I understand R, Python, and have written machine learning
          algorithms from scratch.

          I'm graduating a semester early in December 2021.
