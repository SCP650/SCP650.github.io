<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>2023 </p>
   <p>In the journey of life, we often encounter wisdom that has the power to transform us. But it’s easy, too easy, to let these transformative insights slip away, simply because we fail to act upon them. So I began writing this guide as a personal side-quest to gather the lanterns of wisdom —- those enlightening insights from others that have illuminated my journey. And as life’s game unfolded, my own playthrough, though not without its trials, bore fruit. Friends, colleagues, even strangers began seeking these nuggets of wisdom. Their curiosity was the spark that turned this personal diary into a beacon for others.</p>

<p>But tread lightly. These pages were crafted for my eyes, my interpretation of the game of life. They are not universal cheat codes but rather a collection of strategies that worked for me, in my unique circumstances. Viewer discretion is not just advised, it’s essential. Forge your own path, use these principles as a compass, not a map.</p>

<p>This is a guide I wrote for myself, but now, it’s in your hands. Navigate wisely, and remember, this is not just about playing the game — it’s about changing it.</p>

<h2 id="1-every-action-or-inaction-is-an-investment">1. Every Action or Inaction is an Investment</h2>
<p>Remember, you have only two resources at your disposal: time and money. Both are finite. You have merely 24 hours a day and a budget that’s not endless. Each decision you make, each action you take, is essentially an investment of these resources, with the expectation of a return, be it positive or negative. Take, for instance, the simple decision of dining out with friends. What’s the return you’re seeking? Is it the relaxation from socializing, or the opportunity to learn something new? Weigh the investment of your time and money against the potential return.</p>

<p>This isn’t about forgoing fun; it’s about having a clear objective, even in choices as mundane as eating out. Avoid situations where you end up wasting resources —- like an expensive meal with an annoying friend who can’t stop talking about the new Tesla they leased. For every action you take, you should constantly ask yourself is this a worthy investment?</p>

<h3 id="11-balancing-short-term-vs-long-term-positive-vs-negative-returns">1.1 Balancing Short-term vs Long-term, Positive vs Negative Returns</h3>
<p>Investments don’t always yield immediate, positive returns. Their value often varies based on time. For example, an evening watching Netflix might offer short-term relaxation, but if it becomes a habit, it could lead to long-term stagnation. Conversely, relentlessly working every night might boost your career short-term, but could lead to burnout in the long-term. Striking a balance is key -— allocate time for relaxation and for work. It’s about recognizing the potential positive or negative returns of your actions and finding a harmony that suits your goals.</p>

<h3 id="12-focus-on-investments-that-yield-long-term-dividends">1.2 Focus on Investments That Yield Long-term Dividends</h3>
<p>Some endeavors may not offer immediate returns but can be tremendously beneficial in the long run. For instance, dedicating hours to perfect a personal website, showcasing detailed projects, might not seem fruitful immediately. However, it becomes a portfolio that impresses recruiters, investors, and hiring managers in the years to come. This is a single one-time investment that pays heavy dividends over many many years. Similar long-term investments include learning new skills, attending workshops, or presenting at conferences. These actions might not show immediate results, but over time, they accumulate and pay off significantly.</p>

<h3 id="13-embracing-protective-put-options">1.3 Embracing Protective Put Options</h3>
<p>Just like in financial markets, where traders use put options to minimize losses, you can apply a similar strategy in life. For instance, as I was nearing graduation, I applied to both master’s programs and job positions. The master’s program was my put option -— if I failed to land a desirable job, I could fall back on further education, preventing a worst-case scenario of starting at a less-than-ideal company. Similarly, while pursuing my passion in VR/AR, I also honed skills in iOS engineering as a safety net. The beauty of this approach is its flexibility; you can choose to exercise these put options or not based on your circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="14-capitalizing-on-asymmetric-risk-reward">1.4 Capitalizing on Asymmetric Risk-Reward</h3>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll encounter scenarios with minimal risk but significant potential rewards. A classic example is job applications. The downside is limited—your application might be ignored. But the upside can be tremendous, ranging from job offers to invaluable interview experience. In such scenarios, it pays to be aggressive. Consider outsourcing mundane tasks like job applications to virtual assistants. This leads us to the principle of interchaning time and money.</p>

<h3 id="15-interchangeability-of-time-and-money">1.5 Interchangeability of Time and Money</h3>
<p>Time is more precious than money. You can always make more money, but you can’t make more time. Sometimes, it’s prudent to spend money to save time. Many people make the mistake of trading their time for money in mundane jobs like driving Uber, not realizing they’re not developing any new skills or advancing their careers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, choosing to fly instead of driving to a nearby city might cost more, but it saves precious hours. The decision between flying and driving boils down to what you value more — your time or your money. Similarly, you can easilly outsource mundane tasks like job applications to virtual assistants to save time.</p>

<p>However, there’s an exception to this rule. If an activity brings you joy, it’s not necessarily a waste of time. For instance, I prefer taking the public transit to the airport to enjoy the scenic route, but I opt for a quicker Uber ride home after a tiring flight.</p>

<h3 id="16-weighing-opportunity-cost">1.6 Weighing Opportunity Cost</h3>
<p>In a world of limited resources, every decision carries an opportunity cost. This cost is the road not taken, the choice you forgo when you decide one way. It’s crucial to weigh this carefully. In making a choice, ask yourself what you’re giving up and whether the trade-off is worth it. This mindset will guide you to make more informed, strategic decisions.</p>
