Have you ever tried speaking a new language? It’s hard right? To make it worse, there’s few opportunities to practice. You need to find a fluent speaker to practice with or spend a lot of money to hire a tutor. We want to empower everyone to practice speaking for free.

We are a language learning community to help you practice with other people in virtual worlds. We created a credit system, called TBucks, to make this ecosystem work: You can help others practice speaking in your native tongue to gain TBucks. And then spend TBucks to practice in a new language you want to learn.

You can try it out [here](https://github.com/SCP650/Vrlingo-New)

## Features

### Free Language Practice

We want to build a community where each user is not only a student learning a new language, but also a teacher who helps others with their native language. After the user specifies which languages they know and which they want to learn, we show a live map of all the current instances that are speaking those specified languages. Then the user can choose to join as a teacher to gain TBucks or as a student to spend TBucks . This will build a language learning community and enable users to practice speaking for free.


### Situational

Through our application, users can gain fluency by participating in different scenarios, such as eating at a restaurant, shopping at a store, or going to the park. These environments contain fully interactable props and allow for greater suspension of disbelief during roleplaying in a new language.

### Interactions

Engage with contextually-driven prompts that help support multi-user conversations for learning a new language. For example, when the user picks up some money in the VR restaurant, they are prompted via a hovering interface a few different conversation starters based on the money object, such as “Buy some food with money.” This incites a conversation between the user holding the money and another user in the VR restaurant.

### Monetization

There are three ways we could monetize in the future.

- Ads: We can place immersive ads in the VR world. For example, a branded soda in the restaurant world, or make branded coffee shop as a world for users to practice speaking in.

- Professional Tutors: Some users may appreciate professional tutors such as 1:1 lessons in addition to the free community support. Hence, we can offer classes and take a percentage of the fee.

- Subscriptions: We can offer a monthly subscription where users can gain additional features such as show hints to pronounce when grabbing objects, special status icons, and remove ads.

## Under the Hood 
 
We use Unity and XR Interaction Toolkit to create the app. The multiplayer networking, VOIP, synced variables and avatar sync are created using Normcore.

PS: We created the icon of this page using Stable Diffusion.
