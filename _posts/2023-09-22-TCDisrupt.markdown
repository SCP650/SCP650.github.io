I recently attended the TechCrunch Disrupt event from September 19 to 21, 2023. During these days, I had the opportunity to engage with and glean insights from numerous startup founders. In this article, I'll highlight some of the intriguing startups I came across.

## Yodayoda - Live Street View Data
**Problem**: Street view data has significant value, particularly for industries like construction and tourism. However, data from sources like Google Maps can often be outdated. Currently, there's no effective way to access the freshest street view data.

**Solution**: Yodayoda incentivizes drivers to affix their phones to their car windshields while driving. This setup allows the camera to capture real-time street views paired with precise GPS locations.

**Sebastian's Thoughts**: I'm drawn to the concept of harnessing everyday vehicles to gather the most current data. However, I anticipate a few challenges: 
1. **Duplicates**: If multiple cars use this app and traverse the same route on a given day, Yodayoda would need to compensate all the drivers. This becomes costly if the subsequent data from other cars doesn't offer new insights. If only the first driver gets paid, the compensation diminishes as the user base grows. 
2. **Phone Accessibility**: Many rely on their phones for navigation. Mounting it on the windshield might hinder easy access, especially for those without integrated systems like Apple CarPlay. A better strategy might be partnering with dash cam manufacturers to harvest data directly.
3. **Demand**: The market for real-time street views, especially on an hourly basis, might be limited. A more realistic demand might revolve around weekly updates. This could further reduce the potential earnings for participating drivers.


## ilume - Smart Dog Feeding 
**Problem**: The quantity of food a dog requires varies greatly based on its breed and the amount of daily exercise it gets. Overfeeding can result in obesity, potentially reducing the dog's lifespan.

**Solution**: ilume offers a dual-component system: a step tracker that attaches to the dog's collar and a bowl equipped with a weight sensor. Users input their dog's food calorie density into an app. Daily, owners can view their pet's activity levels. When feeding time arrives, the bowl signals when the right amount of food has been added.

**Sebastian's Thoughts**: I've personally faced this dilemma. I own a sizable Labrador, and feeding him as per the recommendations on the dog food packaging (4 cups daily) resulted in noticeable weight gain within weeks. I adjusted his diet to roughly 3 cups daily, occasionally increasing the amount on particularly active days. This process involves a lot of guesswork, and I'm constantly uncertain if I'm overfeeding or underfeeding him.

Potential challenges include:
1. **Scientific Backing**: The primary hurdle for ilume is establishing a credible ML model that correlates dog activity with caloric needs. Solid scientific evidence is essential to validate their methodology.
2. **Diverse Feeding Styles**: Many dog owners occasionally treat their pets or feed them variable-calorie raw foods. Catering to this range of feeding habits could prove challenging.

## Carrots & Cake - Learn First, Play Later

**Problem**: For numerous households, the iPad serves a dual purpose as both a learning and entertainment tool. But how can parents ensure their kids prioritize educational content over gaming?

**Solution**: Carrots & Cake is a parental control app that empowers parents to set content categories. For instance, children might need to engage in 15 minutes of Duolingo before being granted 30 minutes on Call of Duty Mobile.

**Sebastian's Thoughts**: This app effectively identifies and addresses a specific user pain point. 

Yet, it's not without potential pitfalls:
1. **No Unique Selling Proposition**: The primary distinction for this app lies in its use of the Screen Time API, a feature unknown to many developers. However, during Apple's WWDC 2021 session titled "Meet the Screen Time API", they introduced a similar application called "Homework" that mirrors Carrots & Cake's functionality. The session serves as a step-by-step tutorial on how to create it. 
2. **Pricing Challenges**: The founders are considering a subscription-based model. This might be unfeasible. Given the simplicity in replicating such an app, competitors could easily introduce free versions to the market.

## Pilot - Collaborative Trip Planning  

**Problem**: Organizing a trip involving multiple participants often becomes cumbersome through group chats or even using platforms like Google Docs.

**Solution**: Pilot introduces a shared planning interface where users can intuitively drag and drop itinerary items, complemented by an adjacent map. Notably, it offers auto-generated itineraries and suggests top tourist spots for effortless incorporation into travel plans. Its partnership with Kayak further streamlines the process by allowing in-app bookings. Revenue is generated through affiliate link commissions.

**Sebastian's Thoughts**: This is an ingenious solution to a ubiquitous problem I've frequently faced. While I've yet to test the app, its success seems promising, given robust execution. The affiliate-based revenue model is both logical and scalable. 

The potential challenge might arise if giants like Expedia decide to mimic these features. However, since Pilot isn't in direct contention with booking platforms but rather complements them, this seems less probable. Moreover, replicating such an interactive, collaborative tool isn't a straightforward endeavor. Capitalizing on their pioneer status, Pilot could establish a robust market presence, making it daunting for newcomers. The primary concern might be the user acquisition cost, given the infrequency of travel for most individuals. However, this is surmountable with the right marketing strategies.

## Hal51.ai - 3D Holograms with Your Phone

**Problem**: There's a growing demand for affordable holographic displays.
**Solution**: Hal51.ai offers an innovative box wherein users place their phones. Utilizing reflection techniques, it projects the phone's screen content within the box, all at a price point below $100.

**Sebastian's Thoughts**: This product was visually striking. At first glance, it genuinely appears as if a 3D entity is maneuvering inside the box. However, closer scrutiny reveals it's merely a 2D projection. While its affordable price might make it a fun conversational piece for gatherings, its novelty is likely transient. Its long-term applicability seems limited, especially when compared to more advanced technologies like the looking glass.
 

## ChatGPT Wrappers
The event showcased an abundance of ChatGPT-wrapper startups, spanning domains from coding to cybersecurity, web development, legal assistance, HR, and more. While each had its nuances, a common thread was their low entry barrier. This could spell challenges, especially when established players begin embracing similar functionalities.
