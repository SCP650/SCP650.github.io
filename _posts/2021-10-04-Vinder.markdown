Have you ever felt anxious before a date? Fearing it’s going to be super awkward? Or have you ever felt unsafe since you are meeting a complete stranger in person? We want to fix it. 

Why not have your first date in a safe and goofy environment, like in virtual reality? Our app Vinder envisions how dating will look like in the Metaverse. It’s a standalone app built for Oculus Quest. Using Vinder you can not only get matches but also have your first date in a fun interactive VR environment!

This app is built in 24 hours independently by Sebastian Yang and Arshin Jain for HackCMU. It was the winner of the **Facebook Metaverse Award**.

(Sorry for the poor video quality --- when we finished editing it and we only have like 10 mins before the deadline and we never got a chance to edit it.)

## Under the Hood 

This app is made in Unity with Oculus Quest 2. It uses Photon server to facilitate live virtual meetings between matches. It can run on a windows machine AND standalone in an Oculus Quest 2 headset without the need of a PC.
