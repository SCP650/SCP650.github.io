This is a retell of the Chinese traditional folklore [The Legend of the White Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_White_Snake). The game is developed for Tencent Institute of Games and is available for download at [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%E7%99%BD%E8%9B%87-%E7%BA%B8%E4%BC%9E/id1535362205) or by searching "白蛇·纸伞".


This is one of the most challenging and exciting project I've worked on. I was the Product Manager/Programmer of the game and worked with 8 people across three different timezones to develop this game. 

I led the team to go through 12 sprints in 3 months. We achieved weekly builds, hit 3 release milestones and conducted 5 rounds of user testings.

As always, we did detailed documentation.
