Getting ready for job interviews can be really tough, especially if you're a college student. It usually means asking friends for help, digging up good questions, and practicing by taking turns being the interviewer and the interviewee. But even after all that effort, the feedback you get might not be of high quality because, let's face it, your friends are probably just as new to this as you are.

Now, imagine if you could have a super experienced hiring manager right there in your living room to practice with. That's the idea behind this innovative personal project. In this project, I wanted to learn how to merges the immersive experience of mixed reality with advanced AI technology to tackle real-life problems. If you're curious to see how it works, feel free to check out the video below.
