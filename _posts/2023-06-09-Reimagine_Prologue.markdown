## What is this series about?

Welcome to the "Reimagine" series. In this series, I will select applications from the Top 100 in the app store and reimagine what they would be like in a three-dimensional space, as AR/VR software. We will no longer be confined to the two-dimensional interfaces of mobile phones and computers, but shift our focus towards the more tangible and realistic three-dimensional space provided by AR/VR.

## Why do I write this series?

We can make two basic assumptions about the future of technology:

1. People desire more natural and realistic ways of interaction.

Looking back over the past decade or so, it's clear to see that from the text messages and emails of the 2G era to the pictures and voice messages of the 3G era, and then to the short videos and live broadcasts of the 4G era, the carriers of information flow are becoming increasingly enriched, presenting in ways that are closer to the real world.

2. As three-dimensional beings, humans naturally understand and accept three-dimensional content.

Our everyday lives take place in three-dimensional space. In other words, we are inherently accustomed to interacting in three dimensions, not confined to two-dimensional screens.

Based on these two assumptions, we have reason to believe that spatial computing brought about by AR/VR will be the next growth point in human technology.

However, I found that many people's thinking is still confined to a two-dimensional plane, and it's hard to imagine what WeChat or Taobao would be like in three dimensions. Yet, the software on our phones satisfies various daily needs, which will still exist in the era of spatial computing. This implies that these apps on our phones need to be redesigned and implemented in a three-dimensional environment.

Through this series, I hope to explore with you the possibilities of this new world and envision the various stunning applications that may appear in the future.

## How will I appraoch it? 

To make this series more meaningful, I'll undertake the following steps in my exploration:

Firstly, we need to set up an ideal environment. Assume we already have an ideal AR headset: a comprehensive, smooth, and convenient device that seamlessly integrates virtual information into the real world, providing users with unprecedented interactive experiences.

Under this premise, I'll select a series of killer apps from the app store based on their ranking. These apps may include social, shopping, education, etc., all of which are favored by a broad user base due to their effectiveness in solving certain user needs.

Then, I'll apply the following three-step analysis to these apps:

1. Who is it solving what problem for?
2. Why can AR/VR solve this problem better?
3. What will the specific user experience be like?

Through these steps, I hope to spark our thinking about spatial computing and open our imagination to future technologies.

## Closing

At the start of this journey, I want to make it clear: all the views I share here are my own. These thoughts do not represent the positions of my company or employer, nor do they contain any confidential information. My sole aim is to stimulate imagination and enthusiasm for potential AR/VR applications, helping everyone better understand this new field full of unknowns and possibilities through my personal insights and observations.

I am fully aware that although I've made thoughtful explorations, with technological advancements and the passage of time, my depiction of the future might prove incorrect. Looking back from the future, many of my views may seem naive. But that won't dampen my passion and interest in this exploration. I believe that only through trial and error can we discover new possibilities and innovate better solutions.

Finally, I hope this series will inspire you, and I also look forward to your sharing of ideas and observations.
